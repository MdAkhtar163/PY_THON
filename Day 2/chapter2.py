# 1. Write a python program to add two numbers.
a=10
b=20
sum=a+b
print(sum)

#2. Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z.

a=154
d=3
rem=a%d
print("The reminder is ", rem)

#3. Check the type of variable assigned using input () function.

checktype= input ("input to keyboard ")
print(type(checktype))

#4. Use comparison operator to find out whether ‘a’ given variable a is greater than
# ‘b’ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80

a = 34
b = 80
compa = a<=b
print(compa)

#5. Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user.

a=int(input("Enter the number is a "))
b=int(input("Enter the number is b "))

aver=(a+b)/2
print(aver)
print(type(aver))

#6. Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.

a= int(input("Enter the number by square of number"))
square=a*a
print(square)
print(type(square))
